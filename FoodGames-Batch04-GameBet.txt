	--Batch 04 Start (GameBet)---

Gambit (GameBet)
very similar to MagKneeToe, (but instead of throwing stored metal, he throws "Stored Cards")
he gets "Stored Cards" by consuming a few items mentioned below, which he can either find in game, or by crafting them from paper items, with pens/pencils and glue etc, via some new crafting recipes :o)


main idea is to obtain "Stored Cards", and use some recipes to convert spare 'Pens' and 'Pencils' with 'Sheets Of Paper' into 'Pack Of Playing Cards' (Base.CardDeck).

while MagKneeToe consumed a bunch of metal items in his bag, GameBet instead just consumes a few items:
( consuming each pack of playing cards 'Base.CardDeck' gives GameBet 54 "Stored Cards" (52+2joker) )
( consuming each pack of playing cards 'Base.TarotCardDeck' gives GameBet 78 "Stored Cards" )
( consuming 'Base.BusinessCard_Personal' or 'Base.BusinessCard_Nolans' or 'Base.BusinessCard' gives him 1 "Stored Card" ) 



1st skill throws 3 "stored cards" (lower damage, in lower radius) (like magneto)
2nd skill throws 10 "stored cards" (more damage, in larger radius) (like magneto)
(customisable in sandbox values etc)




definition of existing glue items:
glue (Base.Glue)  OR  duct tape (Base.Scotchtape) OR adhesive tape (Base.DuctTape)


definitions of existing writing items are:
Base.Pencil OR Base.Pen OR Base.RedPen OR Base.BluePen OR Base.Crayons (if one of these items is used in crafting, the whole item is completely used and removed)

PAINT: (if one of the below is used, it only drains it by 10%)
PaintRed,PaintBlack,PaintBlue,PaintBrown,PaintCyan,PaintGreen,PaintGrey,PaintLightBlue,PaintLightBrown,PaintOrange,PaintPink, PaintPurple, PaintTurquoise, PaintWhite, PaintYellow, 



New Crafting Recipes: (need to be able to rightclick on the 1st items, to get the crafting menu, Not the fire source because that has a huge list which lags)
(and if items need a recipe name, it can just be generic like "Make FoodGames Glue", "Make FoodGames Paper", "Make FoodGames CardSheet"

1x (Gum OR RubberBand OR Base.Eraser) + 1 use of lighter / matches etc https://pzwiki.net/wiki/StartFire_(tag) = Base.Glue (has i think 5 uses)
1x (Rubberducky OR Rubberducky2) + 1 lighter / matches etc = 2x Base.Glue

2x Tissue + 1 unit of any glue (Base.Glue)  OR  duct tape (Base.Scotchtape) OR adhesive tape (Base.DuctTape) = 'Sheet of Paper' (i think it's Base.SheetPaper2)

2x Base.ToiletPaper + any 1 glue (Base.Glue)  OR  duct tape (Base.Scotchtape) OR adhesive tape (Base.DuctTape) = Sheet of Paper

2x 'Sheet of Paper' + 1 unit of any 'glue (Base.Glue)  OR  duct tape (Base.Scotchtape) OR adhesive tape (Base.DuctTape)' = "Sheet of Card" (NEW item)

1x Sheet of Card + any Base.Pencil OR Base.Pen OR Base.RedPen OR Base.BluePen OR Base.Crayons  = "Sheet of Playing Card" (NEW item)
1x Sheet of Card + any PAINT (10% drained) = "Sheet of Playing Card"

6x Sheet of Playing Card + Scissors (using Base.Scissors 10% durability or 1 condition = full pack of playing cards (Base.CardDeck)

(assuming 10% condition is used if scissors have 10 max condition = each full condition scissors can make 10 packs of playing cards before those Scissors break)
(if player does not have scissors, another recipe exists which uses any bladed weapon, short/long blade, but lowers its condition by 20% or 2 condition)

Base.Card_Easter OR Base.SheetPaper2 OR PaperNapkins OR Base.Doodle = craft 1 Sheet of Paper

Base.Notebook , Base.Journal ,   Base.PaperBag ,  Base.Lunchbag  , Paperbag_Spiffos , Paperbag_Jays, Base.Tote (tote bag) = craft 5 Sheet of Paper

Base.Mov_CardboardBox = Craft 10 Sheet of Paper

Base.Newspaper, Base.Magazine = Craft 25 Sheet of Paper

Base.Book = Craft 50 Sheet of Paper (this crafting recipe needs a custom Sandbox Option, because i might need to test this with 75 pages per basic book or 100 pages etc)

note: there are tons of items_literature.txt books and skill books and magazines, but if easier we can just use magazine and the basic Base.Book red book for now?
